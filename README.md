# Linpan Landscape Resilience - During Covid19

## Project Description
<p>This is a web map of my research project "Socio-ecological resilience of Linpan landscape in Chengdu Plain". </p>

<p>In this story map, I created a narrative of 1) What is linpan landscape 2) What is socio-ecological resilience theory? 3) Dispersed linpan settlements as “natural social distancing”. 4) Market towns as connections. I would like to show how farmers maintain the social distance in a dispersed living mode, while keeping their connections via rural markets during this special period. By the end of the story map, I created a map using Big Map POI data showing health facilities (including hospitals and pharmacies) in Chengdu metropolitian area.
<p>The reasons are 1) The official Chengdu Statistic Book does not include all the health facilities, some of the rural clinics are too small to be included and the number is not up to date 2) More importantly, I realize that there has been a lot of studies focusing on urban health recently due to covid-19, but very limited research on rural areas. I hope this map can raise public awareness in studying the rural resilience in response to major public health events - by compare and contrast the health facilities dots clustering, we can clearly see that the rural areas are short in the number of health facilities. But this is just one indicator of resilience, in the next step, I would get more data from other sources to make a comprehensive resilience matrix in response to major public health events.</p>

## Data Sources
<p> I used images, text, drone vidoes mainly from my previous fieldwork. For the health facilities POI data, I got from Bigmap, and generated metatiles in Qgis.</p>

## Map Design
<p> I choose correspondense base map design, zoom level, locations based on the study site I surveyed. </p>

<p> This storymap is mainly made for a course GEOG 458: Digital Geography in University of Washington, taught by Prof. Bo Zhao. The story map library is derived from the storymap plugin for leaflet at http://atlefren.github.io/storymap/, and its functionality relies on both leaflet and Boostrap. </p>
